## 🔗 Advanced: Finding Direct Stream URLs <a id="finding-urls"></a>
*If a station isn't in an app database, you might need to hunt for the raw URL yourself.*

> 💡 Pro Tip: Most apps listed at the top have built-in directories. Try searching for the station inside the app first. Use the methods below only if you cannot find the station in your app's search.

How do I find the direct stream URL?
1.  Check the site: Look for links labeled "Winamp," "PLS," "M3U," or "Direct Stream."
2.  The Firefox Method (Recommended):
    * Install [The Stream Detector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hls-stream-detector/) add-on.
    * Crucial Step: Go to the add-on *Options* and untick `Ignore direct links to media files`.
    * Play the radio on the website.
    * Click the add-on icon and select "Copy all visible URLs".
3.  The "Hacker" Method: Open the web player, right-click and select Inspect (or press `F12`). Go to the Network tab, filter by "Media" or "XHR," and then start the player. Look for requests ending in `.mp3`, `.aac`, `.m3u`, or starting with `icecast`/`shoutcast`.

## 🤝 Contributing <a id="contributing"></a>

I welcome contributions! Whether it's a new station, a reliable app, or a discovery tool, this list is kept alive by the community.

**How to submit a station:**

1.  **Check:** Ensure the stream works globally (not geo-blocked).
2.  **Link Type:** Please provide the Official Website link if possible. Direct stream URLs (like `.m3u` or `.mp3`) are accepted, but official sites are preferred as they are less likely to break.
3.  **Format:** If you can, please provide the link in this format:
    ```markdown
    - [Station Name](Link URL): Description (Genre/Country)
    ```

**Got an App, Tool, or Database?**
Feel free to submit those too! Just ensure the app is actively maintained and relevant to internet radio.

To Submit: [Open an Issue](https://github.com/deroverda/recommended-radio-streams/issues) or create a Pull Request.

> 💡 **Curation Note:** This collection focuses on human-curated, unique, and high-quality broadcasts. To keep the list valuable, I generally avoid generic automated "Top 40" loops or low-bitrate streams.
