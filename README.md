## 🔗 Advanced: Finding Direct Stream URLs [⬆](#top) <a id="finding-urls"></a>
*If a station isn't in an app database, you might need to hunt for the raw URL yourself.*

> [!TIP]
> Most apps listed at the top have built-in directories. Try searching for the station inside the app first.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here to open the Guide: How to find Stream URLs</strong></summary>

<br>

**1. Check the site**
Look for links labeled "Winamp," "PLS," "M3U," or "Direct Stream."

**2. The Firefox Method (Recommended)**
*   Install [The Stream Detector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hls-stream-detector/) add-on.
*   **Crucial Step:** Go to the add-on *Options* and uncheck `Ignore direct links to media files`.
*   Play the radio on the website.
*   Click the add-on icon and select "Copy all visible URLs".

**3. The "Hacker" Method**
Open the web player, right-click and select Inspect (or press `F12`). Go to the **Network** tab, filter by "Media" or "XHR," and then start the player. Look for requests ending in `.mp3`, `.aac`, `.m3u`, or starting with `icecast`/`shoutcast`.

### 👑 Artist-Specific Streams
Access hundreds of single-artist, 24/7 streams from the [You.Radio](https://you.radio/search) network.

**The URL Pattern:**
`http://streaming.exclusive.radio/er/SLUG/icecast.audio`

**How to create the `SLUG`:**
Lowercase the name, then remove **spaces**, **punctuation**, and the word **"The"**.

| If the Artist is... | Use this Slug |
| :--- | :--- |
| The Beatles | `beatles` |
| AC/DC | `acdc` |
| Ziggy Marley | `ziggymarley` |
